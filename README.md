#
**üìò Description**

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow, covering data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and deployment. The project is designed to provide insights and predictions using machine learning techniques.

 #
 
 **‚ú® Features**
 
*Data Collection & Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing patterns and relationships in data.

*Model Building: Implementing machine learning models for prediction.

*Model Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using appropriate metrics.

*Deployment: Deploying the model using Flask
#
**üîß Technologies Used**

*Programming Language:* Python

*Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,pickle or joblib ,Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (if deep learning is involved)

*Frameworks:* Flask

*Deployment:* Huggingface space

#
**üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

*Data distribution plots

*Correlation heatmaps

*Feature importance analysis
#
**üîç Model Training & Evaluation**

*Various machine learning models are tested and evaluated.

*Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are analyzed.
#
**üöÄ Deployment**

*The trained model is deployed using Flask 

*The web app takes input from users and provides predictions in real-time. (link : https://tdhanushkumar-task-3.hf.space)
